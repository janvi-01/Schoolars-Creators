                What Is An Education Loan?</h><br>
                <p class="a1">
            Education loans are offered to students to finance their higher education in India and Abroad. Multiple financial institutions like Public sector banks, Private banks, and NBFCs offer education loans to students. </p>  <br>
            <div class="a3">
        <ul>
           <li> The funds provided by the education loan will cover the tuition fees, living expenses, cost of books and supplies, etc. </li>
            <br>
        <li> A loan amount between 1 lac to 1.5 cr can be offered with interest rates starting from 8.15% (latest ROI).</li>
            <br>
        <li>The general education loan process includes searching for a lender, applying for an education loan, getting your loan sanctioned, disbursement of the amount, and the repayment of your education loan</li><br>
           <li> The repayment of education loans starts after the moratorium period in all banks. A moratorium period of around 6 months to 1 year is offered by banks on taking an education loan. </li> <br></ul>
           <pre>                           Moratorium period = Course duration + 6 months/ 1 year (grace period)</pre> <br>
        </div>
           <div class="h1">
            Education Loans can primarily be divided into 2 types:
           </div> 
           <div class="a3">
                   <ul>
                  <li>Secured Education Loan </li> <br>
                  <li> Unsecured Education Loan</li> <br>
                  </ul>
           </div>
            The loan terms offered by banks further depend on the location (overseas, domestic), and course (undergraduate, postgraduate) the student opts for. These factors decide the Loan amount, interest rate, Moratorium period, and Repayment duration. <br>
            
            To know clearly about each of these aspects, keep on reading and comment if you have any further queries.

            What is Collateral?
        </div><b></b>
        <p>     
            Collateral is any form of asset/ property that you pledge to the bank to get your loan. A collateral acts as a security to the bank in case you are unable to repay your loan for any reason. 
        </p>
        <div class="h1">
            1. Secured or Collateralized Education loan
        </div>
        <p>
            A Secured or Collateralized Education Loan is an education loan where you have to pledge collateral (an asset or security) such as a house or land to receive the loan amount.
        </p>
        <div class="h3">
            The collateral accepted by lenders is of two types:
        </div>
        <div class="a3">
            <ul>
            <li>Immovable property: House, flat, or non-agricultural land.<br><li>
           <li> Liquid security: Fixed deposits, Insurance policies (term insurance), or Government bonds.<br></li></ul>
            </div>
            <div class="h1"> 2. Unsecured or Collateral- free Education Loan</div>
            <div class="a3">
                <ul>
                    <li>An Unsecured or Collateral-free education loan is an education loan where the student can take an education loan without having to offer any security or collateral. <br></li>
                    
                </ul>
